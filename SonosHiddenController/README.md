myo Sonos Hidden Controller
===

TLDR: control Spotify with myo without needing it to be the active window.

Simple app that takes commands from the myo armband and sends media keystrokes to your spotify app such that the 
spotify app doesn't need to be the active window, allowing you to change your music with the myo app while working.

Big thanks to
